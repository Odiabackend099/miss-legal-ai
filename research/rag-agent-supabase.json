{"extracted_information": "The provided web content is a n8n community forum post referencing a YouTube tutorial titled 'This RAG AI Agent with n8n + Supabase is the Real Deal'. The post confirms that the tutorial demonstrates implementing an AI Agent with RAG using n8n. It explicitly states that Supabase is used for both the chat memory and the vector database component of the RAG agent. The subsequent discussion among users highlights specific implementation aspects and challenges, such as using the AI Agent node, managing metadata during document loading (Default Document Loader node), using system prompts to ensure the agent queries the vector database, and addressing instances where the agent might bypass the vector store and rely on its own knowledge or chat memory.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["RAG AI Agent implementation", "Integration with n8n", "Integration with Supabase for vector database", "Integration with Supabase for chat memory", "Utilizes n8n AI Agent node", "Utilizes n8n Document Loader node (Default Document Loader node mentioned)", "Use of system prompts/messages to control agent behavior"], "statistics": {"views_on_post": 7400, "users_interacting_with_post": 7}, "temporal_info": {"original_post_date": "Sep 2024", "last_activity_date": "Feb 12 [2024]"}, "geographical_data": {"n8n_location_reference": "Made with â™¥ in Berlin."}, "references": ["YouTube video: This RAG AI Agent with n8n + Supabase is the Real Deal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEI_ePNNfJQ)", "n8n Community forum post: This RAG AI Agent with n8n + Supabase is the Real Deal (/t/this-rag-ai-agent-with-n8n-supabase-is-the-real-deal/54346)", "n8n AI Agent node", "n8n Default Document Loader node", "Supabase Node (mentioned in context of issues)", "Pinecone (mentioned by a user as an alternative vector store experiencing similar issues)"]}
