{"extracted_information": "The provided web content is documentation from Stripe detailing their Billing Automations feature. It describes Stripe Billing automations as a no-code way to build custom, automated workflows for streamlining business processes, enhancing customer communication, and improving revenue recovery. These automations consist of triggers, filter conditions, and actions tailored to specific use cases. The document outlines how to set up, configure, manage, and prioritize these automations. It covers various triggers related to invoices and subscriptions, conditions that can be used to filter events, and actions that can be performed automatically. The content mentions an 'Assistant' which uses AI for generating responses regarding Stripe documentation and integration help via Stripe Shell, but does not describe AI agent capabilities for payment processing itself.
