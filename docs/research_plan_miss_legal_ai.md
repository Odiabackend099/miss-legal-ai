  - Affidavit legal requirements and templates
  - Power of Attorney document compliance
  - NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) compliance requirements
  
- **Voice AI Architecture Patterns**
  - Whisper + GPT-4o + ElevenLabs pipeline optimization
  - Real-time voice processing with low latency
  - Multi-language support for Nigerian languages
  - Emergency detection algorithms and response systems
  - Offline mode voice capabilities
  
- **Integration Architecture Design**
  - WhatsApp Web SDK and Business API integration
  - Emergency notification systems design
  - Flutterwave payment integration optimization
  - N8N workflow automation patterns
  
- **System Architecture & Infrastructure**
  - Hono + tRPC + Supabase backend design
  - Database schema for users, documents, emergencies, payments
  - Real-time voice processing pipeline architecture
  - Scalability considerations for TaaS (100 users) and DaaS models

## Key Questions
1. What are the specific legal requirements for tenancy agreements, affidavits, and POA documents in Nigeria?
2. How can we optimize voice processing latency for real-time conversations?
3. What are the best practices for multi-language voice AI in Nigerian languages?
4. How should we structure the database schema for legal document generation?
5. What security measures are required for NDPR compliance?
6. How can we design the emergency detection and response system?
7. What are the optimal WhatsApp integration patterns for voice messages?
8. How should we structure the payment tiers and subscription management?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: Nigerian legal authority websites, NDPR official documentation
- Voice AI research: Academic papers on multilingual voice processing, emergency detection
- Integration patterns: Official API documentation for WhatsApp, Flutterwave, Twilio
- Architecture patterns: Industry best practices for legal tech and voice AI systems

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: Minimum 3 sources for each legal requirement, official government sources prioritized
- Cross-validation: Compare legal requirements across multiple Nigerian legal resources
- Technical validation: Verify API capabilities and limitations through official documentation

## Expected Deliverables
- ✅ Comprehensive system architecture document with diagrams
- ✅ Database schema design for all system entities  
- ✅ API endpoint specifications for all services
- ✅ Voice processing pipeline technical design
- ✅ Security and compliance framework documentation
- ✅ Integration specifications for third-party services
- ✅ Deployment strategy and scalability plan

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search-focused with deep verification for legal requirements
- Justification: Need to gather extensive information about Nigerian legal standards, voice AI patterns, and system architecture before designing comprehensive technical specifications

## Research Progress Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Research Areas Completed:
1. ✅ **Nigerian Legal Document Requirements**: Comprehensive analysis of tenancy agreements, affidavits, and Power of Attorney legal requirements
2. ✅ **NDPR Compliance Framework**: Detailed understanding of Nigeria Data Protection Regulation and GAID 2025 requirements  
3. ✅ **Voice AI Architecture Patterns**: In-depth research on real-time voice processing, Whisper+GPT-4o+ElevenLabs integration
4. ✅ **Emergency Detection Systems**: Analysis of CNN-based audio distress signal detection algorithms
5. ✅ **WhatsApp Integration Patterns**: Emergency alert system implementation using WhatsApp Business API
6. ✅ **Payment System Integration**: Flutterwave subscription management and payment processing
7. ✅ **Supabase Real-time Architecture**: Database and real-time capabilities for voice and messaging
8. ✅ **Existing ODIA Intelligence Resources**: Analysis of current N8N workflows, payment systems, and API integrations

### Key Research Findings:
- Nigerian legal documents require specific compliance standards and stamp duty considerations
- NDPR/GAID 2025 requires explicit consent, DPO appointment, and automated data retention
- Real-time voice processing achievable with <500ms latency using streaming architecture
- Emergency detection can achieve 79.67% accuracy with Multi-Headed 2D CNN models
- WhatsApp Business API supports emergency notifications with delivery tracking
- Existing ODIA Intelligence infrastructure provides solid foundation for expansion
